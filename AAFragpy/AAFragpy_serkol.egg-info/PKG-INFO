# AAFragpy

Python implementation of secondary particle production model AAFrag (based on QGSJEt-II-04m). The code is modified after the original AAFrag code written on Fortran [1].

This package allows to quickly reconstruct the differential cross-sections of secondary gammas, leptons, and hadrons producing in a result of hadronic interaction between primary hadrons and different targets.

The package allows to calculate the spectrum of products knowing the spectra of primary particles and the composition of the target in the wide energy range from hundreds of MeV to EeVs.

Additional consideration of low-energy nuclear interactions is also possible using Kamae et al. 2006 [2] and Kafexhiu et al. 2014 [3] codes.

Examples of package usage are given in Jupiter Notebook.
